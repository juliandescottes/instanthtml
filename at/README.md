This is the source code. You can use it locally to experiment with AT.

## How to experiment

If you want to try AT,

- clone this repository or [download](http://ariatemplates.com/download) the development version
- or [download](http://ariatemplates.com/download) the production version

### Production Version

This is a pre-packaged version of AT where files are minified and grouped together in bundles.
To get started, copy the `aria` folder to the root of your web server and include both the framework bootstrap and the skin in your HTML page:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/aria/ariatemplates-1.2.0.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/aria/css/atskin-1.2.0.js"></script>

### Development Version

This is the development, un-minified, un-packaged version of the framework.
To get started, copy the `aria` folder to the root of your web server and include the bootstrap file in your HTML page:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/aria/bootstrap.js"></script>
